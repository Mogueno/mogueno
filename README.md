  ## _My background_
   
_Close to 5 years of IT experience as a Full Stack software engineer. The beginning of my career was as a Performance Analyst, through which I have built a profile that differs from the rest of the market mostly because of the analytic profile that I've acquired._

_I enjoy being the owner of the softwares that I build, and working close to the Product/Business team to deliver maximum value to the final customer (Pareto all the way), it is also a oportunity for me to show my creativity and proactivity on the projects that I work for._

Relevant past work experiences 

*Working for the Silicon Valley company Revvable, building the leading experience for powersports dealerships. Maintaining the platform, as taking part on the new features: SMS Messages, Surcharge Support, Chrome Extension, and more. 


* developing and maintaining products for Mercado Livre, the biggest marketplace in Latin America, mostly microservices that have a huge amount of throughput (starting at 8-10K RPM)

*Founder Engineer at AssetReality, WEB3 company that does private investigation and seized asset management for the Law Enforcement, and various others governmental entities.
