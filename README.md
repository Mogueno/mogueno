   _My background_
   
   _The beginning of my career was as a Performance Analyst, through which I have 
   built a profile that differs from the rest of the market, working directly with SEO, 
   UX/UI analysis, CRO focused tasks, optimization for web applications, software 
   architecture and business knowledge._

   _After that, I worked with software development, where I mainly developed projects 
   that used the VTEX e-commerce platform._
   
   _I have also acted as technical leader on both areas, performance and software 
   development, taking part in the decision making process and technical support for 
   the rest of my current company._
