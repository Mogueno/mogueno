_7 years of IT experience as a Full Stack software engineer. The beginning of my career was as a Performance Analyst, through which I have built a profile that differs from the rest of the market mostly because of the analytic profile that I've acquired._

_I enjoy being the owner of the softwares that I build, and working close to the Product/Business team to deliver maximum value to the final customer (Pareto all the way), it is also a oportunity for me to show my creativity and proactivity on the projects that I work for._
